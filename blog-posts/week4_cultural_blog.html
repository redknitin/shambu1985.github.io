                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have explored the importance of the enumerable module and how essential it is to make the code more concise and elegant. The Enumerable module is mixed into many common classes such as Array, Hash, and Range. Further I used the Enumerable#map method as an example, to illustrate how well it works as a substitute for the regular for loops thereby avoiding multiple lines of code to perform the same operation. <br><br><a class="link" href="week4_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>

               <h4 class="blog">17th September 2014</h4>

                  <div class="website-1">
                    <p class="java-img"><img src="http://media.careerbliss.com/cms/job%20hopping_large.jpg" alt="map" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>One of the problems more prevalent in the tech industry is the employee tenure problem. Tech industry has one of the lowest employee tenure averages registered in the past few years.</p>

                    <p>For tech companies, talent retention is even more volatile and the average employee tenure estimated is around 3 years. In one recent ranking of companies with the highest employee turnover rates, the Mountain View, California, company is among the leaders. The median employee tenure at Google is just more than one year, according to the payroll consultancy PayScale. </p>

                    <p>Amazon has the second highest employee turnover of all fortune 500 companies. Headlines like “Amazon’s Stressed Out Culture Is Burning Out Employees” are still in the top search results for “Amazon”.</p>

                    <p>Though Google is known for its perks, it seems that it is not enough to buy employee loyalty and long term commitment. A few reasons behind low employment tenure averages found with Google are low pay rate, high cost of living.  Google hires tons of interns, temps and contractors who have short term contracts.  At the end of their contract, employees have the Google name on their resume and are ready to move on. In addition Google encourages innovation and creativity. Because of that, employees often develop their own companies.</p>

                    <p>Many studies show that the total cost of losing an employee can range from tens of thousands of dollars to 1.5-2X annual salary.</p>

                    <p>PayScale did a survey to identify US companies with the highest and lowest employee tenure, out of the Fortune 500 list. The overall average that they came up with was 3.68 years. Compared to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ report released in January of 2012, the average dropped with 1 year, from 4.6 years.</p>

                    <p>According to a new research from EBRI, the median length of time on the job for American workers in 2012 is just 5.4 years. The graph below shows the median years of tenure for Wage and Salary workers between 1983-2012. The EBRI report reveals that <i>"The historical data show that the U.S. workforce has always had relatively low median tenure: The idea of holding a full-career job and retiring with the proverbial “gold watch” is a myth for most people."</i></p>

                    <p><img src="http://ebriorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/blog-notes-dec12-tenure-fig1.jpg?w=630&h=416" alt="map" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>The tech industry has one of the lowest employee tenure mainly because it’s been growing at a fast pace, especially now that the recession seems to be behind us. It’s also the industry of choice for who are well known for their eagerness to learn as much as possible and as fast as possible, from more than one company.</p>

                    <p>Some of the key actions, a company can take to address a low employee tenure involves a whole variety of factors, and these factors take on different weights depending on the age, demographic, and role of the employee.</p>

                    <p>Some of the other interesting things to consider are compensation, job fit, career opportunities and the work environment. In addition it is also equally important to have a common sense of mission, a deep respect for their employees, put time, energy and money in building a highly engaging environment.</p>

                    <p>Above all, the key for a long-term and productive relationship between employer and employee is providing a stimulating workplace environment, which fosters happy, motivated and empowered individuals.</p>

                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have explored the importance the classes in Ruby and their usage. A class is basically a factory to create objects. An object instantiated from a certain class is called ‘an instance of that class’. Calling the method new on the class creates a new instance of the class. A class contains two features: State and Behavior. State defines the attributes of its instances. Behavior is the code that manipulates or processes the state-data, or non-state data that is used only during a single execution of the code.<br><br><a class="link" href="week5_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>
