                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have presented my ideas about the increasing popularity of Javascript in Web development along with exploring some of the limitations behind it. One of the main reasons JavaScript is called the language of the web is because it works seamlessly across browsers and devices. It is simple, easy to learn and adapt. While there are many things that JavaScript can do to introduce interactivity to your web pages, it does come with some limitations in terms of security, to stop web pages from being able to tamper with your computer and also because of its inability to access the database. <br><br><a class="link" href="week3_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>

              <section class="blog-content">
                  <div class="website-1">
                    <p class="java-img"><img src="../imgs/thinking.png" alt="thinking_styles" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>Each one of us has a personal thinking style that organizes how we interact with other people, information, and problem solving. I believe understanding one’s personal thinking style is a good place to self-acceptance and the acceptance of others. After taking the <a class="link"href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="_blank">personal thinking style quiz</a>, and researching a bit about my thinking style, I found my personal thinking style to be more or less <span>abstract sequential</span>. The theoretical model created by Antony Gregorc helped me understand and figure out my personal thinking style.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy theory, precision, logic, abstract thought and tend to learn best by listening to lectures, independent research and following procedures. I generally give my best working on a particular task in a quiet environment and generally do not prefer to give up unless and until I end up with a satisfactory solution.</p>

                    <p>I prefer to take sufficient time to master a particular topic and do not believe in rushing through it. Currently this approach is working great in completing DBC’s weekly challenges. The best way to handle pressure is to be well equipped for it and act upon it wisely.</p>

                    <p>Referring through multiple resources to gain mastery over a particular topic has always been my method of learning. Also like an AS thinker, I prefer to work alone over the challenges and have never worked together in groups to accomplish a particular task.  Personally I am a bit impatient person and tend to get easily distracted when things are not in my control. Learning experience at Dev Bootcamp has helped me become more patient. I also learnt the importance of pair programming, working together and be a part of the productive experience of learning, figuring out things together.</p>

                    <p>One other exciting thing about being at Dev Bootcamp is to see my own talent growing every week and me getting more and more inclined towards the growth mindset.  Even if I am not so confident about a particular challenge, I tend to face the challenge wholeheartedly, learn from my setbacks, research more and try again. </p>

                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have explored the importance of the enumerable module and how essential it is to make the code more concise and elegant. The Enumerable module is mixed into many common classes such as Array, Hash, and Range. Further I used the Enumerable#map method as an example, to illustrate how well it works as a substitute for the regular for loops thereby avoiding multiple lines of code to perform the same operation. <br><br><a class="link" href="week4_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>
