                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have explored the properties of CSS Box Model along with understanding the differences between margin, padding and border. Margin is the space around the element. Padding is the spacing between the content and the border. Border is the edge of the element. Using the box model, elements can be accurately positioned, thereby enhancing the overall look of the webpage.<br><br><a class="link" href="week2_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>

               <h4 class="blog">9th September 2014</h4>
              </div>

              <section class="blog-content">
                  <div class="website-1">
                    <p>Each web page is a kind of computer program that tells your browser what to do. HTML is a markup language designed for defining static web page content. The browser follows the HTML instructions as it reads and presents the page. Once the page is complete, the browserâ€™s work is done and the HTML program is over.</p>
                      <p class="java-img"><img src="../imgs/javascript.png" alt="javascript" width="100%"></p>
                      <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to introduce some interactivity and dynamism in the web pages rather than it being completely static. It is often used to create polls and quizzes. JavaScript support is built right into the major web browsers including Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari. JavaScript code can go in the same file as HTML by inserting the script tag. jQuery is a JavaScript library that is used to make interactive features even quicker.</p>

                      <p>Up until about ten years ago, JavaScript was only used on the frontend. i.e. it ran in your browser and allowed developers to create interactive elements on websites like slideshows. In the last years, there has been insane development in JavaScript.</p>

                      <p><span>Advantages</span><br><br> In addition JavaScript comes with a few advantages:</p>
                      <ol class="list">
                            <li>JavaScript is the only web programming language that runs both in the frontend and the backend.</li>
                            <li>It is pretty easy to learn and fast. Everything will be done on client side like validations, which is very fast and requires no server side processing. You can even run it as your server side language.</li>
                            <li>It is the only language embedded in browsers and every browser supports JavaScript.</li>
                            <li>JavaScript has tons of project libraries and frameworks.</li>
                            <li>JavaScript allows you to respond to users interacting with a page and perform operations without an expensive round trip to the server.</li>
                      </ol>

                      <p>Above all, JavaScript is the only language available for having your website communicate with the browser and watch for events: clicks, double clicks, mouse enters, mouse exits, key presses, browser window sizing and many others.</p>

                      <p><span>Limitations</span><br><br> No programming language is perfect and JavaScript also has its share of design errors such as overloading of + to mean both addition and concatenation with type coercion. The language is weakly typed. It changes the types dynamically and that can create confusion and generally leads to bugs. One case is when manipulating numbers and strings.</p>

                      <p>Also the reserved word policies are much too strict. Both double and single quotes for strings mean the same in JavaScript but using double quotes for strings in sublime text leads to syntax errors, which can be a little confusing sometimes.</p>

                      <p>Semicolon insertion after every statement can also be annoying and confusing some times as in some cases it is mandatory and in some other cases it is not. You can use semicolon at the end, but you are not required to. If you don't use semicolon, sometimes it might work, sometime it might not. Automatic semicolon insertion is one of JavaScript's most controversial syntactic features and there are also many misconceptions surrounding it.</p>

                      <p>One other limitation is its dependency on the browser. Different browsers interpret JavaScript differently as the browsers have diverse JavaScript engines. Its always safer to test your code in all major browsers before pushing it to production.</p>

                      <p>The most important limitation is the security issue related to JavaScript. A lot of people tend to disable JavaScript in their browsers due to various security reasons. This makes the app broken which not only creates a problem for the web app but also for the user who is trying to enjoy a service.</p>
