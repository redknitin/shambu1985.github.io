                      <p class="img"><img src="../imgs/kitchen.png" alt="website" width="650px"></p><br>
                      <p>Watching <a class="link" href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shareef Bishay's Fireside Chat</a> helped me get a better understanding of the whole structure and the evolution of Dev Bootcamp. The questions and the answers were very informative and well addressed by Shareef.  Initially I had a very limiting mindset, which resembles more of the example in the “restaurant” approach.  I thought of Dev Bootcamp as a place to work more rigorously, get through the culture of the program and a guaranteed job. Reading and talking to people about Dev Bootcamp changed my ideas and opinion about DBC.  I then started off taking control of my own education and getting ready to face any challenge that comes my way.</p><br>

                      <p>I heard people saying that 1 day at Dev Bootcamp is equivalent to 1 week of Phase0. This sometimes makes me feel a bit nervous but at the same time I am really excited to see my own transformation in the next few months. Now that I have successfully completed week1 of Phase 0, I am excited to see how I am already taken out of my comfort zone, meeting people and introducing myself through Google hangouts.</p><br>

                      <p>I have always been coding alone and never ever paired with someone to solve a particular challenge. So I was always a bit hesitant about pair programming and was not sure how the whole thing works. After watching Shareef’s chat about pair programming I understood that pair programming is not just working together but also learning to effectively relate to others and communicate new skills efficiently.</p><br>

                      <p>As a concluding note, I am really excited to get into an entirely new environment, meet new people, learn from others, work harder than I have ever had and come out with flying colors</p>
