                      <p>Watching <a class="link" href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shareef Bishay's Fireside Chat</a> helped me get a better understanding of the whole structure and the evolution of Dev Bootcamp. The questions and the answers were very informative and well addressed by Shareef.  Initially I had a very limiting mindset, which resembles more of the example in the “restaurant” approach.  I thought of Dev Bootcamp as a place to work more rigorously, get through the culture of the program and a guaranteed job. Reading and talking to people about Dev Bootcamp changed my ideas and opinion about DBC.  I then started off taking control of my own education and getting ready to face any challenge that comes my way.</p><br>

                      <p>I heard people saying that 1 day at Dev Bootcamp is equivalent to 1 week of Phase0. This sometimes makes me feel a bit nervous but at the same time I am really excited to see my own transformation in the next few months. Now that I have successfully completed week1 of Phase 0, I am excited to see how I am already taken out of my comfort zone, meeting people and introducing myself through Google hangouts.</p><br>

                      <p>I have always been coding alone and never ever paired with someone to solve a particular challenge. So I was always a bit hesitant about pair programming and was not sure how the whole thing works. After watching Shareef’s chat about pair programming I understood that pair programming is not just working together but also learning to effectively relate to others and communicate new skills efficiently.</p><br>

                      <p>As a concluding note, I am really excited to get into an entirely new environment, meet new people, learn from others, work harder than I have ever had and come out with flying colors</p>

                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have explored the properties of CSS Box Model along with understanding the differences between margin, padding and border. Margin is the space around the element. Padding is the spacing between the content and the border. Border is the edge of the element. Using the box model, elements can be accurately positioned, thereby enhancing the overall look of the webpage.<br><br><a class="link" href="week2_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>
