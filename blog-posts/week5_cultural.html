                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have explored the importance the classes in Ruby and their usage. A class is basically a factory to create objects. An object instantiated from a certain class is called ‘an instance of that class’. Calling the method new on the class creates a new instance of the class. A class contains two features: State and Behavior. State defines the attributes of its instances. Behavior is the code that manipulates or processes the state-data, or non-state data that is used only during a single execution of the code.<br><br><a class="link" href="week5_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>

               <h4 class="blog">23rd September 2014</h4>
              </div>

              <section class="blog-content">
                  <div class="website-1">
                    <p class="java-img"><img src="../imgs/pair.png" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>Before starting Phase 0 I had a totally different perception about pair programming. I have been working on different software projects alone throughout my career and never really tried the experience of pairing with someone and working together.  So I was a bit hesitant initially regarding the idea of pairing as I am used to figuring out things alone. After about 5 weeks of Phase0, my perception and ideology about pair programming has changed and I can see a great transformation in me. Pair programming has not only helped me to grow technically but also culturally in terms of good interpersonal communication and openness.</p>
                    <p>Based on my experience, I found it really amazing to work with equally talented
                    fellow developers and getting to know each other’s working methodology and trying to adopt some of them which inspires you. Pair programming has always helped me learn more, sharing ideas with peers and benefitting from their insights. I also got better at articulating my thoughts and enjoyed several “aha” moments, researching and figuring out new concepts while pairing. In addition there were amazing times when a pairing session ended for like 5 hours and we were able to knock out 3 to 4 of the challenges all together. </p>
                    <p>Pairing has always turned out to be beneficial to me in every way and I am really looking forward to pairing with peers in person. </p>
                    <p><span>Feedback</span></p>
                    <p>Getting feedback has helped me a lot to evaluate and improve myself to get better and better at every pairing session. Being personally a bit impatient, the first few feedbacks I received had a consistent message saying I should be a little more patient when I notice my pair is taking what may seem to me, a long time.  I recognize that I should be more patient and give my pair a chance to think uninterrupted and help them express their ideas.  The first few actionable feedback I received helped me become a more patient coworker and have had many productive pairing sessions since then. I have always found that, teaching my pair or sharing some knowledge is indeed a great feeling and it reinforces my understanding of the topic to a great extent.</p>
                    <p>As far as giving feedback is concerned, I always enjoyed giving kind and specific feedback. Writing actionable feedback has always been a little difficult for me especially when the task you handled was pretty easy and you had a great time working with your pair. This has helped me increase my critical thinking skills as to analyze the pairing session and offer some helpful suggestions to my partner to help make their next session more productive. </p>
                    <p>Above all, it has always been an incredible experience working with everyone so far and I totally look forward to more pairing sessions.</p>
