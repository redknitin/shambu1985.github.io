  <div class="reflection">
    <p>This was a pretty fun and exciting challenge for both me and my pair. We both were equally experienced with the technical stuff and this helped us to complete the challenge with fun and ease. I got to learn many sublime text shortcuts and tips of making optimum use of chrome dev tools from my pairing partner. Initially we took some time to get adjusted to our driver and navigation roles and there seemed to be some moments of silence or one sided communication between us. But then within a few minutes we got adjusted to and in sync with each other's working methodology. I found the pairing session quite productive and I enjoyed working with my pair who had different perspectives and coding/working styles and we discussed things rationally. In a solo programming session, I can do good work once I get into the zone but if at all I get stuck on something, I tend to get distracted and spend hours figuring out the solution. Working together in a pair helps me maintain the time limit, keeps me focussed and figuring out things together becomes more kind of a fun.<br><br>

    Overall the pairing session was great fun and I absolutely look forward to more such pairing sessions in future.</p>
