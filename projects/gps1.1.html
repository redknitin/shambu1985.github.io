          <h3 class="heading"> What is pair programming? </h3>
          <p class="para"> Pair programming is a programming methodology wherein two developers work together on a specific project in the same workstation using a single computer. It is composed of two roles: Driver and the navigator. The driver is the one who has full control over the keyboard and is responsible for proper symantics and syntax of the program. Navigator is the one who reviews each line of code checking in for errors and giving suggesstions as to improve the overall design. It basically encourages better coding practice, shared knowledge throughout your team, better time management adn higher productivity.</p>

          <h3> Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
          <p> Pair programming is the most encouraged practice in the industry today. DBC encorages pairing and teaches you empathy and the art of working colaboratively with fellow developers.</p>

          <h3> Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
          <p> Driver is the one doing the actual coding and navigator is the one navigating the driver and giving suggestions to improve the overall performance</p>

          <h3> Guidelines for pairing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Check in with your partner at the beginning of each pairing session.</li>
            <li> Discuss about the driver and navigator roles and their responsibilities in the pairing session</li>
            <li> Plan to switch roles after some time.</li>
            <li> Make sure to leave feedback after each pairing session.</li>
          </ul>
